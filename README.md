## 💼 Summary

I'm a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in **Vue.js**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**, passionate about building robust web and mobile applications. I began my journey as a frontend developer and quickly expanded into backend development, infrastructure setup, and DevOps. Over the years, I've delivered end-to-end solutions — from CI/CD pipelines and remote server management to self-hosted map systems using **OpenStreetMap**, and cross-platform mobile apps with **React Native** and **SwiftUI**.

One of my most challenging and rewarding projects was a 3D dental treatment visualization system built with **Nuxt3** and **Three.js**, integrating **Google Cloud Storage** for dynamic 3D model loading. The platform consisted of a visualization frontend, admin dashboard, and a REST API backend. I also led the development of a companion treatment management system for the same client, showcasing my ability to manage complex, multi-component architectures.

### 🏥 Clear-Smile 3D plan visualization – 3D scene teeth treatment plans
> This app was real challange for me because it was mostly about 3D renderings. I did not created any 3D/webgl apps before from scratch. I was askend many diffuclt features like:
>  Rulers - to measure the distance between two points placed at 3d model,
> Grid-Scale overlay - which opeque overlay with vertically and horizontally crossed lines which in between equally spaced and each line has specific measured labels and these measurement is calculated based on Camera Type and distance with special variables.
>  Occlusogram - is the heat map which represents penetration and distance with [-1, 1] mm threshold if penetrates marks with red if in distance it is blue and as a result we got the heatmaps.
> Loading and adding skull parts of the patient head to the teeths scene.
> Slider to show each change steps as animation
