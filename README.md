## 💼 Summary

I'm a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in **Vue.js**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**, passionate about building robust web and mobile applications. I began my journey as a frontend developer and quickly expanded into backend development, infrastructure setup, and DevOps. Over the years, I've delivered end-to-end solutions — from CI/CD pipelines and remote server management to self-hosted map systems using **OpenStreetMap**, and cross-platform mobile apps with **React Native** and **SwiftUI**.

One of my most challenging and rewarding projects was a 3D dental treatment visualization system built with **Nuxt3** and **Three.js**, integrating **Google Cloud Storage** for dynamic 3D model loading. The platform consisted of a visualization frontend, admin dashboard, and a REST API backend. I also led the development of a companion treatment management system for the same client, showcasing my ability to manage complex, multi-component architectures.
